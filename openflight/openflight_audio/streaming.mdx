This guide will walk you through the steps to capture and stream video in real-time from a camera or other device using the OpenFlight Video streaming module for Python. We assume that all necessary dependencies and packages have already been installed and configured on your system.

```py
# First, we need to import the necessary modules and classes from the OpenFlight GPT video streaming module. 
# In this example, we'll use the asyncio and signal modules to handle asynchronous tasks and signals, 
# respectively, as well as the OpenFlightVideoStream class to capture and stream video data.

import asyncio
import signal
import openflight
from openflight.video.streaming import OpenFlightVideoStream

# Next, we'll create an instance of the OpenFlightVideoStream class and configure it with the desired settings for our 
# video stream. This may include specifying the input device (e.g., camera), resolution, frame rate, and encoding format, among other options.

video_stream = OpenFlightVideoStream()
video_stream.set_input_device(0)  # Use default camera device
video_stream.set_resolution(640, 480)  # Set video resolution to 640x480
video_stream.set_frame_rate(30)  # Set frame rate to 30 fps
video_stream.set_encoding_format('h264')  # Use H.264 encoding format

# Now that we've configured our video stream, we can start capturing and streaming video data using the start() 
# method of our OpenFlightVideoStream object. This will launch an asynchronous task to continuously capture and encode 
# video frames, which can then be sent to a network socket or other destination for further processing or display.

# Define signal handler for clean shutdown
async def handle_signal():
  signal_received = False
  for signame in {'SIGINT', 'SIGTERM'}:
    asyncio.get_event_loop().add_signal_handler(getattr(signal, signame), lambda: asyncio.create_task(shutdown()))
  while not signal_received:
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def shutdown():
  video_stream.stop()
  tasks = [t for t in asyncio.all_tasks() if t is not asyncio.current_task()]
  [task.cancel() for task in tasks]
  await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Start video stream
try:
  video_stream.start()
  asyncio.run(handle_signal())
except Exception as e:
  print(f'Error: {e}')
```

And that's it! With these steps, you should now be able to capture and stream video data in real-time using the OpenFlight 
Video streaming module for Python. Of course, there may be additional configuration or customization options depending on 
your specific use case or requirements, so be sure to consult the documentation and other resources for more information.
